### Planned examples

#### Simple test programs

    1. countQuery            -- packet counter + event to query for count
    2. recircCount           -- count packets on recirculation 

#### Applications
    3.  countMin             -- count min sketch with query, insert, and clear events
    4.  bloomFilter          -- bloom filter with query, insert, and clear methods
    5.  windowBloomFilter    -- Bloom filter with timeouts via sliding windows
    6.  switchMLSimple       -- in network parameter aggregation, assumes no packet loss
    7.  switchMLFull         -- in network parameter aggregation with loss handling
    8.  turboFlow            -- minimal netflow with custom fields
    9.  ontasFlow            -- extend turboFlow with simple anonymization 
    10. mac learner          -- basic mac learning


#### Progress

1, 2, 3, 4, 6

- 5 (windowBloomFilter) will take a while
- 7 (switchMLFill) will take a while

Notes: 
    We could really use external handlers or functions in switchMLSimple or some way to represent multicasting packets (generate_ports).
        - All pretty straightforward to add.
